Overall, traffic in the Mission District is generally moving at a moderate pace. Expect typical city congestion on most streets.

A large number of streets are experiencing similar traffic conditions – it’s busy out there, but not gridlocked. Lexington Street, Capp Street, and San Carlos Street are all seeing fairly similar levels of traffic. You might want to avoid scheduling any deliveries that require precise timing on these roads.

Liberty Street, Folsom Street, South Van Ness Avenue, Valencia Street, Lapidge Street, 18th Street, 17th Street, Treat Avenue, Guerrero Street, 21st Street, Linda Street, 20th Street, Mission Street, Albion Street, Dearborn Street, and 22nd Street are all experiencing similar conditions – expect a bit of a slowdown, but nothing too terrible. It's a good time to catch up on your podcasts, or maybe just accept your fate.

However, Camp Street and Sycamore Street are experiencing very light traffic – a perfect opportunity for a leisurely drive, or maybe even some impromptu street painting! 

Finally, Shotwell Street is also experiencing moderate traffic, so plan accordingly.
