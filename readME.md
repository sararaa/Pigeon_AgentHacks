# Project Coordination System for the City of Pasadena 

A comprehensive municipal project management platform that enables departments to coordinate geofenced project areas, prevent scheduling conflicts, and maintain transparent communication across city operations.

## Overview

This system allows city departments and contractors to register project areas with geographic boundaries, track project lifecycles, and automatically detect potential conflicts in timing or location overlap. The platform ensures efficient coordination of public works, construction, and municipal projects.

## Features

### üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Project Management
- **Interactive Maps Interface**: User-friendly GUI for defining project boundaries
- **Geofenced Areas**: Draw and store precise geographic boundaries for each project
- **Visual Project Overlay**: See all active projects on a unified map view

### üìã Project Registration
- **Department Assignment**: Link projects to specific city departments
- **Duration Tracking**: Set start dates, estimated completion, and actual timelines
- **Access Restrictions**: Mark areas as restricted or open during project execution
- **Contractor Integration**: Include contractor information and contact details when applicable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflict Detection & Alerts
- **Automated Overlap Detection**: Cross-reference all projects for geographic and temporal conflicts
- **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notifications when potential conflicts are identified
- **Department Coordination**: Direct contact information for conflicting project managers
- **Conflict Resolution Workflow**: Streamlined process for resolving scheduling conflicts

### üìä Project Lifecycle Management
- **Individual Project Pages**: Dedicated dashboard for each project (accessible via unique project ID)
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor project phases from planning to completion
- **Delay Notifications**: Alert system for project extensions or delays
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Automated notifications to affected departments and contractors

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Projects Table**: Core project information, departments, dates, restrictions
- **Geofences Table**: Geographic boundary data and coordinates
- **Contractors Table**: Contractor details and contact information
- **Conflicts Table**: Detected overlaps and resolution status
- **Notifications Table**: Alert history and delivery status

### Core Components
- **Map Interface**: Interactive mapping system for boundary definition
- **Conflict Engine**: Algorithm for detecting geographic and temporal overlaps
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel alert delivery (email, dashboard, SMS)
- **Project Dashboard**: Individual project tracking and lifecycle management
