Overall, traffic in the Mission District is generally moving at a moderate pace. Expect some slowdowns, but nothing too drastic.

There are a *lot* of streets experiencing relatively smooth traffic flow – Dearborn Street, Shotwell Street, and Valencia Street are good examples. This is a great time to get deliveries made, or even consider some roadwork if needed!

Camp Street and Bird Street are experiencing very light traffic – practically a breeze! You could probably knit a sweater while driving down those streets.

However, be prepared for heavier congestion on streets like 21st Street, Hill Street, and Folsom Street. It won’t be a complete standstill, but it won’t be a joyride either.
